# Pentesting Checklists and Reporting Templates
Various checklists and reporting templates that pentesters can use to ensure full coverage during their engagements. I currently have created checklists for web, API, and (partial) mobile pentesting engagements. I took the mobile checklist from wherewhere else, don't remember where, all credit to wherever first created it. Feel free to submit suggestions as PRs.
